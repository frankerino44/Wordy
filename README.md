Kinda crazy what happens when you actually start the project at a somewhat reasonable time lol.<br>
From what I can see everything works exactly as I want it to.<br>
Really enjoyed working on this one.<br>
<br>
I ended up doing all three extra credits along with some QOL stuff.<br>
<br>
The hard mode works by prompting you with a dialog notif either on create or when you restart (not clear).<br>
If all correct letters from the previous guess aren't in the current guess, it shoots a toast.<br>
<br>
The clear database function also prompts with a dialog notif (seemed like it was appropriate since it can't be reversed).<br>
<br>
My custom extra credit was an activity to view the database in the app.<br>
I used a list view. When it gets too big, you can scroll. If the database is empty, the listview is empty.<br>
<br>
I also made it so that if the database is empty upon opening the main activity, it shoots out a dialog notif.<br>
Regardless of whether or not OK is pressed, when the dialog is dismissed it takes you to the add word screen.
